The Odoo Website Builder is an excellent tool for creating a website fully-integrated with the other
Odoo apps. Playing with the theme's options and building blocks is easy and allows you to
personalize your web presence the way you want. But what if you want to take things even further?

In this documentation, you will discover every step of Odoo Theming. By the time youâ€™re done, you
will be able to completely customize your website without touching the Odoo core files, and this way,
preserve the editing options of the Website Builder.

The information compiled in this documentation are based on our past experiences - both failures and
successes. We invite you to use it as a base to build your own website and adapt it to your needs.

.. note::
   This documentation is meant to work with Odoo 15.0
